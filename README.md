Welcome to my GitHub!

<br>

## Who am I?
I'm a young self-thought hobby front-end developer.

I started coding in JavaScript around 2020 when I created cheats for a [game](https://www.moomoo.io/).

Then I heard about [KaiOS](https://www.kaiostech.com/) and started developing apps and games for it.

With that I gathered expierience and skills.

And now I'm here able to code fully functional apps & games.

<br>

## What am I working with?
I basically only create apps for KaiOS using HTML, CSS and mostly VanillaJS.

That's the only thing I do at the moment.
